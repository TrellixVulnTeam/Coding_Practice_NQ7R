#DISTANCE FORMULA
#Hamming Distance
#Hamming Distance is another slightly different variation on the distance formula. Instead of finding the difference of each dimension, Hamming distance only cares about whether the dimensions are exactly equal. When finding the Hamming distance between two points, add one for every dimension that has different values.

# Hamming distance is used in spell checking algorithms. For example, the Hamming distance between the word “there” and the typo “thete” is one. Each letter is a dimension, and each dimension has the same value except for one.

# Instructions
# 1.
# Below manhattan_distance(), define your function in the same way as before. It should be named hamming_distance() and have two parameters named pt1 and pt2.

# Create a variable named distance, have it start at 0, and return it.

# 2.
# After defining distance, create a for loop to loop through the dimensions of each point. If the values at each dimension are different, add 1 to distance.

# Once again, the structure of the for loop should be identical to Euclidean and Manhattan.

# This time, compare pt1[i] and pt2[i].

# 3.
# hamming_distance() is done as well!

# Print the Hamming distance between [1, 2] and [1, 100].

# Print the Hamming distance between [5, 4, 9] and [1, 7, 9].

  distance = 0

    distance += (pt1[i] - pt2[i]) ** 2
  return distance ** 0.5

def manhattan_distance(pt1, pt2):
  distance = 0
  for i in range(len(pt1)):
    distance += abs(pt1[i] - pt2[i])
  return distance

  distance = 0
  for i in range(len(pt1)):
    distance += 1 if pt1[i] != pt2[i] else 0
  return distance
