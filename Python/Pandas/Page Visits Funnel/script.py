#DATA ANALYSIS WITH PANDAS
# Page Visits Funnel
# Cool T-Shirts Inc. has asked you to analyze data on visits to their website. Your job is to build a funnel, which is a description of how many people continue to the next step of a multi-step process.
# In this case, our funnel is going to describe the following process:
# A user visits CoolTShirts.com
# A user adds a t-shirt to their cart
# A user clicks checkout
# A user actually purchases a t-shirt
# If you get stuck during this project or would like to see an experienced developer work through it, click Get Help to see a project walkthrough video.

visits = pd.read_csv('visits.csv',

                   parse_dates=[1])
checkout = pd.read_csv('checkout.csv',
                       parse_dates=[1])
purchase = pd.read_csv('purchase.csv',
                       parse_dates=[1])

#Inspect the DataFrames using print and head:
#visits lists all of the users who have visited the website
#cart lists all of the users who have added a t-shirt to their cart
#checkout lists all of the users who have started the checkout
#purchase lists all of the users who have purchased a t-shirt

#Combine visits and cart using a left merge.
#If we want to combine df1 and df2 with a left merge, we use the following code:
# pd.merge(df1, df2, how='left')
# OR
# df1.merge(df2, how='left')

#How long is your merged DataFrame?
#Use len to find out the number of rows in a DataFrame.

#What do these null rows mean?
#You can select null rows from column1 of a DataFrame df using the following code:
#df[df.column1.isnull()]

#What percent of users who visited Cool T-Shirts Inc. ended up not placing a t-shirt in their cart?
#Note: To calculate percentages, it will be helpful to turn either the numerator or the denominator into a float, by using float(), with the number to convert passed in as input. Otherwise, Python will use integer division, which truncates decimal points.
#If a row of your merged DataFrame has cart_time equal to null, then that user visited the website, but did not place a t-shirt in their cart.

#Repeat the left merge for cart and checkout and count null values. What percentage of users put items in their cart, but did not proceed to checkout?
#You can find the percentage of users who put items in their cart but did not proceed to checkout by counting the null values of checkout_time and comparing it to the total number of users who put items in their cart.

#Using the giant merged DataFrame all_data that you created, letâ€™s calculate the average time from initial visit to final purchase. Start by adding the following column to your DataFrame:
#all_data['time_to_purchase'] = \
#    all_data.purchase_time - \
#    all_data.visit_time
all_data['time_to_purchase'] = \
    all_data.purchase_time - \
    all_data.visit_time

#Examine the results using:
#print(all_data.time_to_purchase)
print(all_data.time_to_purchase)

#Calculate the average time to purchase using the following code:
#print(all_data.time_to_purchase.mean())
print(all_data.time_to_purchase.mean())

# print(all_data)
