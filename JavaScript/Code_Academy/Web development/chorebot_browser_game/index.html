Now your first objective is to build one door which will hide the dreaded ChoreBot.

Look at the index.html starting code. Inside the <body>, create a <div> parent element with the class name "door-row". Next, create an <img> child element inside this <div>.-->
    	<img id='door1' class='door-frame' src='https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/projects/chore-door/images/closed_door.svg'>
      <img id='door2' class='door-frame' src='https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/projects/chore-door/images/closed_door.svg'>
      <img id='door3' class='door-frame' src='https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/projects/chore-door/images/closed_door.svg'>
    </div>
    <div id='start' class='start-row'>Good Luck!</div>
    
    <!--
The pointer's purpose is to indicate to the user that the closed door image can be clicked. CSS made this possible; but it's the JavaScript that makes that click do something.

All JavaScript logic will be written within the script.js file but in order to have that logic interact with the HTML, you first need to establish a connection between the script.js page and the index.html. In the index.html page, create a <script> element directly above the closing </body> tag. Inside the opening <script> tag, set the type as "text/javascript" and the src as "script.js". Then immediately close the element with a </script> tag.-->
    <script src='script.js' type='text/javascript'></script>
  </body>
